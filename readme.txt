Content Types is a WordPress plugin that helps you create custom content types in WordPress.

== Description ==

Content Types is a WordPress plugin that helps you create custom content types in WordPress. It allows for custom categories, custom tags, and custom input fields.

The plugin uses the content types extensions built into WordPress 3 and therefore is only supported in WordPress 3+.

The plugin allows advanced users to make completely custom entry fields. View a few of these fields in the screenshots.

***Reminder:** You must turn on permalinks for posts in order for content type permalinks to work.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload `content-types-wordpress-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I contact you? =

E-mail, Phone, Chat. Visit: http://scottreeddesign.com/contact

= Will you implement a feature if I donate a specified amount? =

I will be happy to do a custom installation to include custom field options.

= Is "Content Types" compatible with WordPress installations lower than Version 3? =

No it isn't.

== Screenshots ==

1. Does the layout in the above image look familiar? It should. The content types plugin uses itself to build itself. In fact “Content Types” are stored as a content type itself. How meta is that? 
2. The image above shows how a content type is created/edited. Once page form to build all that you need for any content type. This is a sample content type where I used every prebuilt field type that comes with the plugin.
3. The image above shows editing a custom content type. Each field gets it’s own meta box so the fields can be dragged and drop to the right column as well.
